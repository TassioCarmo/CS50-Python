# Functions, Variables

- Learn to read a documentation

## Creating Code with Python

- code hello.py to start coding.
- .py is the python format
- write a code for example print("hello, world")
- in the terminal write
- python hello.py

**python is not only a language but also an interpreter**

## Functions

- Functions are verbs or actions let's you do something in the program

### Arguments

- it's an input to a function that somehow influence its behaviour

### Side Effects

- it's something that appears on the screen when a function does something

### Bugs

- is a mistake in a code
- Computers take you literally andif you don't finish your thouights in the way the language expects is not going to work

### Input

- get input from the user

```
input("what is your name")
```
### Return

- return input from the user

### Variable

- Container for some value

```
name = input("what is your name")
```

- = assigns a value to something

### Comments 

- Are notes for yourself in your code

```
# this is a comment
```

### Pseudocode

- express your thoughts succinctly, methodically, algorithmically,
- your intent, a todo list
- breaks a bigger program down into small bite-sized tasks

### print multiple

- concatenation
```
input("hello " + name)
```

- multiple arguments
- when you pass multiple arguments to print, it automatically inserts a space for you.
```
input("hello ", name )
```

### String

- A string, known as a str in Python, is a sequence of text.

### parameters

- what you can pass to a function and what those inputs are called, those are parameters

the difference between parameters and arguments

when you're talking about what you can pass to a function and what those inputs are called, those are parameters. When you actually use the function and pass in values inside of those parentheses, those inputs, those values are arguments. So we're talking about the exact same thing-- parameters and arguments are effectively the same thing, but the terms you use from looking at the problem from different directions. When we're looking at what the function can take versus what you're actually passing into the function.

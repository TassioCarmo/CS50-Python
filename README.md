# Functions, Variables

## Creating Code with Python

- code hello.py to start coding.
- .py is the python format
- write a code for example print("hello, world")
- in the terminal write
- python hello.py

**python is not only a language but also an interpreter**

## Functions

- Functions are verbs or actions let's you do something in the program

### Arguments

- it's an input to a function that somehow influence its behaviour

### Side Effects

- it's something that appears on the screen when a function does something

### Bugs

- is a mistake in a code
- Computers take you literally andif you don't finish your thouights in the way the language expects is not going to work

### Input

- get input from the user

```
input("what is your name")
```
### Return

- return input from the user

### Variable

- Container for some value

```
name = input("what is your name")
```

- = assigns a value to something

### Comments 

- Are notes for yourself in your code

```
# this is a comment
```

### Pseudocode

- express your thoughts succinctly, methodically, algorithmically,
- your intent, a todo list
- breaks a bigger program down into small bite-sized tasks

### print multiple

- concatenation
```
input("hello " + name)
```

- multiple arguments
- when you pass multiple arguments to print, it automatically inserts a space for you.
```
input("hello ", name )
```

### String

- A string, known as a str in Python, is a sequence of text.
